# Click-It

## Description
A simple memory game built in react (create-react-app), using images inspired by characters in the game Final Fantasy VI. Twelve images in total and the user begins the game when they click on one. With each click, the images will "shuffle" and the score will keep track of how many unique images have been clicked. Seems simple? Well if you click any image more than once, you lose!
